# vanilla luna

this is the operating system set up i currently run. i'd prefer to have vib compile these changes locally than have github's datacenters guzzle up water, but it isn't that advanced yet i don't think. 

it supports openrgb. i replaced wpa_supplicant with the newer iwd because it works better with my wifi card. it includes the wonderful [dreymar's big bag](https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixXKB) keyboard setups for xkb (among the default layouts). make sure to enable extend in gnome tweaks. there is also my own [shavian](https://shavian.info) mapping based off of the shaw 2-layer layout
