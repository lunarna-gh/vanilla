# vanilla luna
this is the operating system set up i currently run. i'd prefer to have vib compile these changes locally than have github's datacenters guzzle up water, but it isn't that advanced yet i don't think. 
i replaced wpa_supplicant with the newer iwd because it works better with my wifi card.
it includes the wonderful [dreymar's big bag](https://github.com/DreymaR/BigBagKbdTrixXKB) keyboard setups for xkb (among the default layouts). if you're going to be using this for yourself you may need to add the extend layer manually as seen in https://github.com/lunarna-gh/vanilla-luna/commit/0c7d90009299496d50da45d4af3585b33e75ada4. there is also my own original [shavian](https://shavian.info) mapping based off of the shaw 2-layer layout
